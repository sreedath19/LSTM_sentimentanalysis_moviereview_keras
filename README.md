# LSTM_sentimentanalysis_moviereview_keras
Sentiment analysis done on imdb movie review data set using LSTM/RNN network(deep learning)


The data set is downloaded
Preprocessing is done
id matrix is created using the term frequency technique
Feature extraction is done and datamatrix is obtained 
The datamatrix is split into training and testing datamatrices
The Deep neural network is trained and evaluated using training and testing data matrices respectively
Input text is obtained
The text is preprocessed and a textvector is made from idmatrix
The textvector is fed to the neural network and the sentiment score is obtained
